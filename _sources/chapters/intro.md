## Introduction

The Molass Comunity welcomes anyone interested in SEC-SAXS data analysis. Feel free to let us know by opening issues in the GitHub repository using the button at the upper right corner of any page.

This book is intended to help contributors to the project.

Skilled programmers should skip the first chapter on environments, for those are simple orientations attended to beginners.

## Acknowledging GitHub Copilot

As we wrote this book, we realized the importance of cleverly utilizing `GitHub Copilot`[^1], the AI programming assistant. Specifically, we don't need to describe in detail what GitHub Copilot can do. Instead, by assuming its assistance, it may be more effective or sufficient to focus on what to ask and leave the descriptive work[^2] to `GitHub Copilot`, which can handle certain (potentially tedious) tasks more efficiently.[^3]

This section serves as a general assertion and will not be repeated verbosely throughout the book, except in cases where its significance needs to be emphasized.

[^1]: Or any other assistant of your choice. "Cleverly" here means that we should be also fully aware of its weaknesses, at this level of `intelligence`, such as verbosity, lack of concentration, know-all attitude, risk-avoiding execuses, etc., not to be confused with human wisdom.

[^2]: That is, we do not need to include such details in this book. Instead, it will suffice to state only the key points, without omitting a minimal description to avoid the loss of clarity. With some hints on what to ask or how to ask, which we will not omit, further details, which we will omit, can be left to the assistant, who can help in your need.

[^3]: See [Coding Style](coding_style) for such style of description.
