# Jupyter Environment

For working on Jupyter Notebooks, we recommend either of the following environments.

## Jupyter Lab

If you have Python installed, you can install Jupyter Lab via pip as follows.

```none
pip install jupyterlab
```

After installation, start Jupyter Lab from the command prompt as follows.

```none
jupyter lab
```

This will open a Jupyter Lab page on your browser.

## VS Code Jupyter Extension

They provide a Jupyter Extention in VS Code. Select the extensions icon ![extension](../../images/extensions.svg) in the side bar, search for "Jupyter" and install.
