# Context for Refining and Restructuring Pre-Prepared Context Files

## Purpose
This file is designed to guide the process of refining and restructuring pre-prepared context files to ensure they are concise, clear, and aligned with foundational principles that serve as axioms for effective AI-assisted development.

## Goals
1. **Simplify and Standardize**:
   - Ensure context files have short, intuitive names.
   - Make the purpose of each file concise and actionable.
   - Move detailed explanations into the corresponding context files.

2. **Align with Core Rules**:
   - Ensure all context files adhere to the following principles:
     1. **Preserve Essential Context**: Help developers save and manage task-specific context.
     2. **Engineer Explicit Instructions**: Guide developers in providing clear prompts to Copilot.
     3. **Independently Verify AI Output**: Encourage developers to review and validate Copilot's suggestions.

3. **Provide Clear Selection Mechanism**:
   - Create a concise table summarizing the purpose and availability of each context file.
   - Add an "Availability" column to indicate the maturity of each file (e.g., "Available," "Draft," "Planned").

4. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Treat the context files as living documents that evolve based on feedback and practical use.

## Workflow
1. **Review Existing Context Files**:
   - Open each pre-prepared context file and evaluate its purpose, structure, and content.
   - Ensure the purpose is clear and concise, and move detailed explanations into the file itself.

2. **Simplify the Table in the Chapter**:
   - Update the table in the "AI Assisted Development" chapter to reflect the refined context files.
   - Ensure each row fits on a single line and includes the file name, purpose, and availability.

3. **Refine Naming and Structure**:
   - Use short, intuitive names for context files (e.g., `APPLY_CONTEXT.md`, `DEBUG_CONTEXT.md`).
   - Ensure the structure of each file is consistent and easy to follow.

4. **Iterate and Test**:
   - Refine the files iteratively based on feedback and practical use.
   - Test the usability of the files by applying them to real-world tasks.

## Example Table for Refined Context Files

| **Context File**           | **Purpose**                     | **Availability** |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| `APPLY_CONTEXT.md`         | Simplify applying suggestions.   | Available        |
| `DEBUG_CONTEXT.md`         | Assist with debugging tasks.     | Draft            |
| `REFACTOR_CONTEXT.md`      | Guide code refactoring.          | Planned          |
| `DOC_CONTEXT.md`           | Improve documentation.           | Available        |
| `TEST_CONTEXT.md`          | Support writing tests.           | Draft            |
| `FEATURE_CONTEXT.md`       | Assist with adding features.     | Planned          |

## Tips for Refinement
1. **Focus on Clarity**:
   - Use simple, precise language to describe the purpose of each file.
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity or jargon.

2. **Ensure Consistency**:
   - Use a consistent structure and naming convention across all context files.
   - Align the files with the Core Rules for effective AI-assisted coding.

3. **Encourage Feedback**:
   - Share the refined files with your team or collaborators for feedback.
   - Incorporate suggestions to improve usability and relevance.

## Final Note
This context file is intended to guide the refinement and restructuring process. As you work, remember to iterate and adapt based on practical use and feedback. The goal is to create context files that are clear, concise, and aligned with the needs of developers using VS Code and GitHub Copilot.
