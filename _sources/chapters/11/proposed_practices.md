## Practices for Effective AI-Assisted Coding

When working with AI tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT, certain practices can help you get the most out of your coding sessions:

### 1. **Managing Dialog Context**
- AI assistants often rely on the current session's context to provide relevant suggestions or answers.
- If you close and reopen your editor or browser, the context may be lost, and the AI may not "remember" previous interactions.
- To maintain continuity, consider keeping important prompts, code snippets, or decisions documented in your project notes or comments.

### 2. **Session Independence Across Windows**
- Each VS Code window or instance maintains its own context with the AI assistant.
- Dialogs, suggestions, and code completions are independent between windows.
- Be mindful that switching between windows or projects may result in different AI behavior or suggestions, as the context does not carry over.

### 3. **Documenting Key Interactions**
- When an AI assistant provides a particularly useful suggestion or explanation, document it in your code comments or a project log.
- This helps you and your collaborators understand the reasoning behind certain decisions, especially if the context is lost in future sessions.

### 4. **Prompt Engineering**
- Be specific and clear in your prompts to the AI for better results.
- If you need to revisit a topic, restate the necessary context in your new prompt.

### 5. **Review and Verification**
- Always review AI-generated code for correctness, security, and adherence to your projectâ€™s standards.
- Use AI as a tool to assist, not replace, your own judgment and expertise.

By following these practices, you can make your AI-assisted development more effective, consistent, and reliable.
