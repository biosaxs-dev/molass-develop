# Exercise for Collaborators

## Exercise: Accepting a Contribution as a Collaborator

Suppose a contributor has submitted a pull request (PR) that adds a new utility function to the project. As a collaborator, your task is to review and accept this contribution.

**Steps:**
1. **Review the PR:**  
   - Check the code for correctness, clarity, and adherence to the projectâ€™s coding style.
   - Ensure the contributor has provided appropriate documentation and tests.

2. **Provide Feedback:**  
   - If improvements are needed, leave constructive comments and request changes.
   - If the code is satisfactory, approve the PR.

3. **Merge the PR:**  
   - Once all checks pass and you are satisfied, merge the PR into the main branch.

**Example Scenario:**
A contributor submits the following function:

```python
def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b
```

- Review the function for style and correctness.
- Check if a similar function already exists.
- Ensure there is a corresponding test.
- Approve and merge if everything is in order.

**Tip:**  
Always thank the contributor for their effort and encourage further contributions!
