   - Suggest improvements or ask for clarification where necessary.
3. Test the Code:
   - Pull the contributor's branch to your local machine:
```
git fetch origin <branch-name>
git checkout <branch-name>
```
   - Run the tests or manually verify the functionality.

4. Merge the Pull Request:
   - If the code meets all requirements, approve the pull request.
